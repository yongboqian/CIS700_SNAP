This tutorial will tell you how to do Text-to-Speech in ROS


Prerequisite:
	Package sound_play and its dependencies (use $ rosdep install sound_play if dependencies not satisfied)



Steps:
	1. Fire up sound_play node.
		$ roslaunch sound_play soundplay_node.launch
		This actually providing an actionlib service for soundplay

	2. Run example script.
		$ rosrun sound_play say.py "Greetings Human, my name is squirtle."
		Then the computer will say this sentence!
		You can look into say.py to get what you need to write your own speech script.



NOTE: 
	The voice pronouncer can be changed(will shown in later tutorial).
