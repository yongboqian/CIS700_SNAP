Things controller must do:
0!) Prevent robot from crashing into itself
1!) publish elevator current position
2) move elevator using elevator
3!) get parameters


Todo:

start up publisher to publish position to joint
cmd to always check if limit is switched. maybe go slower if it is and update the position


1) write controller to load elevator and just output position on request


Launch file=> arbotix_driver=> inialize stuff =>init servos (even elevator)=> init controllers=> goes to controller file and calls class?

arbotix driver inits joints publishers and controller and then updates them. io might have to be specified along with new controller


-now: how to set position of elevator

-create a joint that is not a dynamixel and specify that it is driven by the elevator servo?
can i do this


Notes to end day:
-I understand the controller much better now!
- controller skeletonis set up to set speed of elevator motor and to read if
it is safe to move elevator by reading in digital input
- I put a basic directino control in for now to control it use:
rostopic pub -1 /elevator_slider_link/command_direction std_msgs/Float64 0.0
for negative number use -- -1.0
- there are some controller code that i left incase it was important so it may get in the way later
- the config yaml file has been updated to start the elevator joint and link and to publish the limit switch states

-Things to do:
-- finish controller code
--- how to calibrate location. setspeed in down direction until limit is hit. then start recording from there
--- i need to put in limit trips (harware)
--- i need to fix elevator motor
--- come up with code to keep track of elevator position based on speed or position of motor.
--- come up with a way to handle position commands/goals
